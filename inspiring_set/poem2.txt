I feel the pain around me the walls are closing in
The echoed sound of silenced hearts in all the noble men
I hear the screams and cries coming in so loud
No one can save the untamed souls of this fleeting crowd
None escape my power as they try to catch their breath
You run so fast so far so long but you can not run from Death
